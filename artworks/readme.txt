Push Artwork to /saves/mame/artwork/

In Retrobat Mame
Config system : 
EMULATOR > MAME64
Visual Rendering > Disable Artwork > No

NB:
AVSP and DINO games : add qsound_hle.zip in your folder mame rom (MAME64 needs this file with avsp and dino)
ALTBEAST : use altbeast.7z 4MO

If you have a problem and the keys are not recognized, you can try on RetroBat to put 
Advanced System Options > Emulator > Mame64
and launch the game
and then 
Advanced System Options > Emulator > Auto
and launch the game
and again 
Advanced System Options > Emulator > Mame64
and test.
This seems to reset a few things and has already helped me get Final Fight working, for example.

In Mame RetroBat, to change instruction card, press and hold start, then use the up and down buttons to select which instruction card to display.
